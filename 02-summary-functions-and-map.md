#### Summary functions

Pandas provides many simple "summary functions" (not an official name) which restructure the data in some useful way. For example, consider the describe() method:

``` python
reviews.points.describe()
#count    129971.000000
#mean         88.447138
#             ...      
#75%          91.000000
#max         100.000000
#Name: points, Length: 8, dtype: float64
```

This method generates a high-level summary of the attributes of the given column. It is type-aware, meaning that its output changes based on the data type of the input. The output above only makes sense for numerical data; for string data here's what we get:

``` python
reviews.taster_name.describe()
#count         103727
#unique            19
#top       Roger Voss
#freq           25514
#Name: taster_name, dtype: object
```

If you want to get some particular simple summary statistic about a column in a DataFrame or a Series, there is usually a helpful pandas function that makes it happen.

For example, to see the mean of the points allotted (e.g. how well an averagely rated wine does), we can use the mean() function:

``` python
reviews.points.mean()
#88.44713820775404
```

To see a list of unique values we can use the unique() function:

``` python
reviews.taster_name.unique()
#array(['Kerin Oâ€™Keefe', 'Roger Voss', 'Paul Gregutt',
#       'Alexander Peartree', 'Michael Schachner', 'Anna Lee C. Iijima',
#       'Virginie Boone', 'Matt Kettmann', nan, 'Sean P. Sullivan',
#       'Jim Gordon', 'Joe Czerwinski', 'Anne Krebiehl\xa0MW',
#       'Lauren Buzzeo', 'Mike DeSimone', 'Jeff Jenssen',
#       'Susan Kostrzewa', 'Carrie Dykes', 'Fiona Adams',
#       'Christina Pickard'], dtype=object)
```

To see a list of unique values and how often they occur in the dataset, we can use the value_counts() method:

``` python
reviews.taster_name.value_counts()
#Roger Voss           25514
#Michael Schachner    15134
#                     ...  
#Fiona Adams             27
#Christina Pickard        6
#Name: taster_name, Length: 19, dtype: int64
```

#### Maps

A map is a term, borrowed from mathematics, for a function that takes one set of values and "maps" them to another set of values. In data science we often have a need for creating new representations from existing data, or for transforming data from the format it is in now to the format that we want it to be in later. Maps are what handle this work, making them extremely important for getting your work done!

There are two mapping methods that you will use often.

map() is the first, and slightly simpler one. For example, suppose that we wanted to remean the scores the wines received to 0. We can do this as follows:

``` python
review_points_mean = reviews.points.mean()
reviews.points.map(lambda p: p - review_points_mean)
#0        -1.447138
#1        -1.447138
#            ...   
#129969    1.552862
#129970    1.552862
Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64
```

The function you pass to map() should expect a single value from the Series (a point value, in the above example), and return a transformed version of that value. map() returns a new Series where all the values have been transformed by your function.

apply() is the equivalent method if we want to transform a whole DataFrame by calling a custom method on each row.

``` python
def remean_points(row):
  row.points = row.points - review_points_mean
  return row

reviews.apply(remean_points, axis='columns')
```

If we had called reviews.apply() with axis='index', then instead of passing a function to transform each row, we would need to give a function to transform each column.

Note that map() and apply() return new, transformed Series and DataFrames, respectively. They don't modify the original data they're called on. If we look at the first row of reviews, we can see that it still has its original points value.

Pandas provides many common mapping operations as built-ins. For example, here's a faster way of remeaning our points column:

``` python
review_points_mean = reviews.points.mean()
reviews.points - review_points_mean
#0        -1.447138
#1        -1.447138
#            ...   
#129969    1.552862
#129970    1.552862
#Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64
```

In this code we are performing an operation between a lot of values on the left-hand side (everything in the Series) and a single value on the right-hand side (the mean value). Pandas looks at this expression and figures out that we must mean to subtract that mean value from every value in the dataset.

Pandas will also understand what to do if we perform these operations between Series of equal length. For example, an easy way of combining country and region information in the dataset would be to do the following:

``` python
reviews.country + " - " + reviews.region_1
#0            Italy - Etna
#1                     NaN
#               ...       
#129969    France - Alsace
#129970    France - Alsace
#Length: 129971, dtype: object
```

These operators are faster than map() or apply() because they uses speed ups built into pandas. All of the standard Python operators (>, <, ==, and so on) work in this manner.

However, they are not as flexible as map() or apply(), which can do more advanced things, like applying conditional logic, which cannot be done with addition and subtraction alone.
